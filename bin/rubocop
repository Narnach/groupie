# Run Rubocop with sane defaults
# - only recognized file types: allows you to pipe in anything and have Ruboop only check files it thinks it can handle
# - force exclusion: even when piping in files, it still ignores what I should not touch
# - display style guide: help figure out what a rule is supposed to do
# - safe: don't run experimental cops
# - display only fail level offenses: hides INFO severity failing cops
